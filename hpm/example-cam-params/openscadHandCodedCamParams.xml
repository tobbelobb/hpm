     focal length depends on png width and height in openscad.
     The found value was:
     f = (3377.17 + 3374.53)/2 = 3375.9 px
     3377.17 was found through creating images of a 2560 mm long block
     from various distances between 3377 and 3378, carefully watching
     at what distance we got exactly the whole width of the cube included in the image.
     The second value, 3374.53, was found by moving the camera 1 mm (1 pixel width) to the right,
     and then move the camera closer to the cube until the right edge of the image matched exactly
     with the right edge of the cube.

     We observe that this measured value is within 1 px of the value that
     the calibration script found which was 3376.3.
     3375.9 - 3376.3 = -0.4

     This whole process will become far easier in the future, when we will be able to directly set
     field of view in the image.
     Then we can calculate f from fov like
     f = (image_width/2)/sin(fov/2)



     cx = image_width/2 = 1280
     cy = image_height/2 = 671.5
