     There are six markers:
     marker 0, marker 1, marker 2, marker 3, marker 4, and marker 5

     They are ordered in counter clockwise order starting with the
     marker to the left (negative X-direction) of the two A-markers
     (along the side that faces towards the A-anchor):

     We want the positions of the (centers of the) markers,
     expressed in the global coordinate system,
     (that is the XYZ-one that the slicer uses),
     measured when the nozzle is placed at the origin.

     The marker positions in this file were computed with
     the help of hp-mark/find-marker-positions/solve.py
     Run/study that script if you don't know how to find your
     marker positions.

     Run the script twice, once for the effector marker positions,
     and once for the bed marker positions, if you have those.
