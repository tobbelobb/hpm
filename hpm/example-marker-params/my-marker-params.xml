     There are six markers:
     marker 0, marker 1, marker 2, marker 3, marker 4, and marker 5

     They are ordered in counter clockwise order, and red-green-blue order,
     starting with the two red markers:
     marker 0 = red 0
     marker 1 = red 1
     marker 2 = green 0
     marker 3 = green 1
     marker 4 = blue 0
     marker 5 = blue 1

     The side with the red markers are directed straight towards
     the A-anchor (which is on the negative y-axis).
     Therefore the two red markers should have the same y-coordinate.

     We want the positions of the (centers of the) markers,
     expressed in the global coordinate system,
     (that is the XYZ-one that the slicer uses),
     measured when the nozzle is placed at the origin.

     The marker positions in this file were computed with
     the help of hp-mark/find-marker-positions/solve.py
     Run/study that script if you don't know how to find your
     marker positions.
