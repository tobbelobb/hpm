     There are six markers:
     marker 0, marker 1, marker 2, marker 3, marker 4, and marker 5

     They are ordered in counter clockwise order starting with the
     marker to the left (negative X-direction) of the two A-markers
     (along the site that faces towards the A-anchor):

     We want the positions of the (centers of the) markers,
     expressed in the global coordinate system,
     (that is the XYZ-one that the slicer uses),
     measured when the nozzle is placed at the origin.

     The marker positions in this file were computed with
     the help of hp-mark/find-marker-positions/solve.py
     Run/study that script if you don't know how to find your
     marker positions.
